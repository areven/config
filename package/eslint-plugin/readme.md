This package is part of [`@areven/config`](https://github.com/areven/config), the central monorepo that contains our reusable configuration presets for linting, formatting, and tooling.


## Philosophy

This config is **strict**, **opinionated**, and **non-negotiable**.

It reflects the coding standards we follow at [Areven](https://areven.com) across **all** projects — open-source and internal. We don’t aim to be flexible or accommodate every style — this works for us, and it stays that way.

These packages are open-sourced mainly to make our expectations clear for contributors. If you’re contributing to any of our projects, please follow the conventions defined here.


## License

The package is [MIT licensed](https://github.com/areven/config/blob/main/license.md).
